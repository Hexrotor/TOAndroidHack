## Functions

### Better Target Lock

Aimbot for Striker and Scorpio (target forcing lock)

Note: The server has hack detection, you must **MANUALLY** aim at the target during the aiming charging, or you will only shoot one valid rocket.

### Remember Targeted Player

Once you start aimming someone, your target won't lost unless you try to aim at another player, and the target mark will keep on your screen so you can know where is it.

For Striker, it means you can track someone's location;

For Scorpio, it means you can anytime shoot your target at anywhere because the aiming result didn't lost.
